# Personal React App Starter for Babel 7, Webpack 4

The boilerplate I use to start React projects so I know exactly what goes in it.

Explanation: http://caioalonso.com/2018/11/27/personal-react-starter-for-babel-7-webpack-4.html

## Instructions

`npm start` to start the dev server, `npm run build` to build. That's it.
